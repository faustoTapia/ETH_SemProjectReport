abstract = {Omnidirectional MAVs are a growing field, with demonstrated advantages for aerial interaction and uninhibited observation. While systems with complete pose omnidirectionality and high hover efficiency have been developed independently, a robust system that combines the two has not been demonstrated to date. This paper presents VoliroX: a novel omnidirectional vehicle that can exert a wrench in any orientation while maintaining efficient flight configurations. The system design is presented, and a 6 DOF geometric control that is robust to singularities. Flight experiments further demonstrate and verify its capabilities.},

abstract = {Drones are all around us. The typical drones we hear about or see around us are most often hobby related. However, the potential of using drones for commercial use started several years ago. Primarily, drones are being used were a person might have difficulty reaching or getting a bird's-eye view of a particular area. This spans from agriculture to building maintenance to selling real estate.[1] Another growing use for drones is custom delivery of packages. In the coming years, there is no doubt that many new uses for drones will be discovered. As such, the journey has just begun where drones are now solving real business issues and no longer considered just a toy},

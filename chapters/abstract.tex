Many control techniques used in multi-rotor flying vehicles only use feed-forward commands to spin the propellers. This includes an omnidirectional micro aerial vehicle (OMAV) with coaxial propellers introduced in this report. For highly complex systems, such as the vehicle introduced in this report, unaccounted perturbations can cause instabilities and significant errors. Therefore, electronic speed controller (ESC) behavior was analyzed as well as the capabilities to perform feedback control for rotor speed in the context of coaxial rotors. It is found that the throttle to rotor speed commanded is not linear and is inconsistent between items of the same model due to motor and electronic mismatches. A model of voltage and throttle dependent rotor speed is suggested for feed-forward commands. Response speed, efficiency and interactions in the coaxial propeller setup are also analyzed. Concluding, Bidirectional Dshot and UAVCAN protocols are suggested for better tracking of rotor speed for several-rotor vehicles, as well as meticulous calibration if only feed-forward rotor speed control methods are used.
